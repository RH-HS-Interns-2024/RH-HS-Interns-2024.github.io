<h1>About Me!</h1>
<h2>Niyam Badani</h2>
<p>Hi I'm Niyam! I currently am 17 years old and live in Lexington, Massachusetts. 
 <br>
 <br>
 I attend Buckingham Browne & Nichols (BB&N) and I will be a senior next year. In school, I am involved with student council, the South Asian Student Association Club, the Admissions Office, the Digital Marketing Club, and film. Additionally, I've played basketball, soccer, and golf for my school's teams. I enjoy going to school in Harvard Square, especially during the beautiful fall weather.
 <br>
 <br>
 Career wise, I'm interested in Data Science, Business Operations, and Asset Management/Valuation. I have had a strong interest in personal finance for about 8 years and have been investing independently. This past year, I got involved with data visualization and data analytics which has driven my interest to enter a field that involves an intersection between Data and Business. Although I am not quite sure where my career will take me, I hope it will be somewhere within these fields.
 <br>
 <br>
 Outside of school, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family and eating food, playing games, and watching sports. I also love playing golf, soccer, and basketball. My favorite season is the fall and I love skiing in the winter as well. I love the fall because whenever I am not working on the weekends, I can play golf in the perfect cool weather, then go watch Football and track my fantasy football team!</p>
