            <h3>Professional</h3>
            <p>
                As a dedicated backend developer with three years of experience at Red Hat, 
                I have had the privilege of contributing to various impactful teams, 
                including Cost Management and FedRAMP in ConsoleDot, 
                as well as Event-Driven Ansible in the Ansible division. 
                My journey in software development has been both enriching and rewarding, 
                providing me with invaluable experiences and the opportunity to collaborate with exceptional colleagues. 
                Proficient in Python, PostgreSQL databases, Docker, and OpenShift commands, 
                I am passionate about leveraging my technical skills to deliver innovative solutions and drive success 
                in every project I undertake.

            <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I have a diverse range of hobbies that keep me engaged and entertained. 
                I enjoy reading, drawing, and solving puzzle games. In my free time, 
                I love playing video games on my custom-built PC, particularly Minecraft and ARK. 
                I also relish playing Switch games like Animal Crossing, Pok√©mon, and Mario Party. 
                Being outdoors is another passion of mine; I enjoy kayaking, swimming, horseback riding, 
                and have recently started exploring gardening in my yard. My three dogs, Aria, Artos, and Baylee, 
                are my constant companions and the joy of my life.
